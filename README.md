**Project Overview**
In today's corporate landscape, diversity and inclusion (D&I) are pivotal for fostering innovation and ensuring equitable opportunities. This project aims to analyze D&I metrics within an organization to identify strengths and areas for improvement. By leveraging Power BI, we provide interactive visualizations that offer insights into the organization's D&I initiatives.

**Dataset Description**
The analysis is based on the "Pharma Group AG" dataset, which contains information on employee demographics, hiring, promotions, performance ratings, and turnover. The dataset includes the following key columns:

Employee ID: Unique identifier for each employee.
Gender: Gender of the employee.
New hire FY20?: Indicates if the employee was hired in the fiscal year 2020.
Promotion in FY21?: Indicates if the employee was promoted in the fiscal year 2021.
FY20 Performance Rating: Performance rating of the employee for FY20.
Turnover: Indicates if the employee left the organization.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
The following KPIs were defined to measure the organization's D&I efforts:
Diversity Ratio: Percentage of female employees within the organization.
% Hires (Men & Women): Proportion of male and female hires during FY20.
% Promotions (Men & Women): Proportion of male and female employees promoted in FY21.
% Turnover: Percentage of employees who left the organization during FY20.
Average Performance Rating (Men & Women): Average performance ratings segmented by gender for FY20.

**Data Analysis and Visualizations**
Interactive visualizations were created using Power BI to represent the KPIs effectively:

Diversity Ratio: Displayed using a card visualization to highlight the percentage of female employees.
Hiring Diversity: Represented using a pie chart to show the proportion of male and female hires in FY20.
Promotion Analysis: Visualized using a stacked column chart to compare promotions across genders.
Turnover Analysis: Depicted using a line chart to show turnover trends over time.
Performance Ratings: Shown using a bar chart to compare average performance ratings between male and female employees.
Insights and Recommendations
The analysis revealed the following insights:

Diversity Ratio: The organization has a female representation of 45%, indicating a relatively balanced gender distribution.
Hiring Trends: In FY20, 60% of new hires were male, suggesting an opportunity to enhance female recruitment strategies.
Promotion Rates: Promotion rates were equal across genders, reflecting equitable advancement opportunities.
Turnover Rates: The overall turnover rate was 10%, with a slightly higher turnover observed among female employees.
Performance Ratings: Average performance ratings were consistent across genders, indicating fairness in performance evaluations.

**Recommendations:**
Enhance Female Recruitment: Implement targeted recruitment campaigns to attract more female candidates.
Address Turnover Causes: Conduct exit interviews to understand and mitigate factors contributing to higher female turnover.
Continuous Monitoring: Regularly track D&I metrics to ensure ongoing progress and address emerging issues promptly.
